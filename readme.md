# Kronos Operational Hub: Critical Infrastructure Convergence Lab

An industrial cybersecurity and operations environment designed to bridge the gap between **Biomedical/Process Telemetry**, **OT Control Systems**, and **Secure IT/Database Architecture**. This repository demonstrates cyber-physical resilience by design.

## 🌐 The Convergence of Three Worlds

This architecture unifies three distinct technical disciplines into a single resilient ecosystem:

### 1. Biomedical & Process Layer (Safety & Physics)
* Focuses on the physical impact of telemetry and industrial safety.
* Monitors critical process variables (e.g., cold chain preservation, chemical boundaries, sensor metrics).
* Establishes hardware-level constraints that the software layer must never violate.

### 2. Software & Control Layer (Logic & OT)
* Handles the communication protocols and operational logic.
* Emulates PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) states and automation vectors.
* Orchestrates data pipelines using deterministic scripts and custom control sockets.

### 3. Database & Network Layer (IT & Identity)
* Manages the "Crown Jewels"—user authentication, secure API endpoints, and identity protection.
* Handles high-throughput data storage for real-time telemetry.
* Hardens the storage layer against unauthorized queries and tampering.
